### Hello

I am the Research Director for AI at PARC. My personal interest is the intersection of people and technology. In particular, I study the role of technology in complex social systems or using data science to better understand those systems. Besides overseeing a portfolio of innovation projects at PARC, I work on  AI Ethics and combating misinformation online.

Specialties: Technology and society, AI ethics, natural language processing, conversational agents, data science, and complex systems.
