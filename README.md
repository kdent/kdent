### Hello

I am an artificial intelligence researcher and data scientist interested in the interplay between people and technology. I co-chair the AI Ethics Committee and lead R&D projects as manager of the Machine Learning and Data Science group at the Palo Alto Research Center (formerly Xerox PARC). I am currently working on AI Ethics and misinformation online.

Specialties: Technology and society, AI ethics, natural language processing, conversational agents, data science, and complex systems.
